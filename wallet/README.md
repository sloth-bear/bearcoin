# Goal
* Persist wallets (by adding layer)
* Implement signatures and verifications with public key, private key in cryptography

# Concepts
## Hash, signature
Enable checking the owner owns transaction output referenced by the transaction input.

## Signature
Enable verifying the owner approve the transaction. When the owner is going to make transaction is going to sign. Because of this, blockchain can check whether the owner signed the transaction.
